# Alloy TMBundle
This is a bundle for Textmate 2, which supports the [Alloy: a language & tool for relational models](http://alloy.mit.edu/). 

I created it because I like Textmate and because I don't like the default Alloy editor or the Alloy4Eclipse. My primary goal is to model with Alloy so the bundle is very simple. 

## Capabilities
- syntax highlighting
- text folding
- text indenting

**The bundle does not allow to run / simulate the model!**

# Installation
Download the bundle into the TextMate Bundles folder:
```
~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles 
```
